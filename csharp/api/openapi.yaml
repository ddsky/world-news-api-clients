                      text: "New Jersey continues to shake after Friday’s 4.8-magnitude\
                        \ earthquake and likely will continue to do so for some time.\
                        \ Dozens of aftershocks were recorded in the Garden State\
                        \ since the rare quake hit, including one tremor of 3.8 after\
                        \ the initial event. But residents of NYC shouldn’t expect\
                        \ anything beyond possibly a light shake in the coming days.\
                        \ Rumbles were measured in 29 nine areas around Whitehouse\
                        \ Station, NJ, which was the epicenter of the quake, including\
                        \ near Tewksbury and Bedminster, according to the United States\
                        \ Geological Survey. The smaller temblors hit as far as 13\
                        \ miles away from the epicenter. One clocked in at 1.9 just\
                        \ after 1 a.m. Saturday morning just north of Whitehouse Station\
                        \ — about 45 miles west of NYC — and another at 2.5 just before\
                        \ 7 a.m. near Gladstone, northeast of the epicenter. Over\
                        \ the next week, there is a 74% chance of additional 3-plus\
                        \ magnitude aftershocks, but the USGS does not foresee more\
                        \ than five occurring. There is just a 14% chance of a quake\
                        \ clocking in at a magnitude of 4 or higher, and likely only\
                        \ one will come this week. Over the course of the next month,\
                        \ however, the chance of a 3-plus magnitude quake rises to\
                        \ 84%, while a the chance of a 4 or greater is 18%. It’s almost\
                        \ certain — 98% — that more 3-plus magnitude shakers will\
                        \ come in the next year, the USGS said. The nearly 30 rumbles\
                        \ that followed the first quake aren’t a shock to geologists,\
                        \ though. “We do expect aftershocks like this to occur in\
                        \ the days, weeks and months after the main shock, so this\
                        \ is fully within the realm of what is expected,” USGS research\
                        \ geologist Alex Hatem told The Post. The chance of NYC feeling\
                        \ another rattle, however, is low. A light shake could be\
                        \ possible in the coming days, Hatem said, but nothing like\
                        \ the quake that rocked the Statue of Liberty and City Hall\
                        \ Friday or the aftershock that rippled through later that\
                        \ evening. The quake grounded flights and halted traffic around\
                        \ the Big Apple. “Should this sequence continue as it is,\
                        \ which we expect it to, there won’t be anything greater than\
                        \ what already happened,” Hatem said. Though researchers expect\
                        \ earthquakes to happen “anytime, anywhere,” it is a rare\
                        \ occurrence for New Jersey, which doesn’t lie on an active\
                        \ plate boundary, Hatem said. The incident did occur, however,\
                        \ near the Ramapo Fault, which is an ancient crack in the\
                        \ Earth’s crust. Faults lie on the edges of plates and can\
                        \ sometimes be the site of quakes. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy\
                        \ posted on X Saturday that the state’s emergency operations\
                        \ center was deactivated that morning. “We have had no reports\
                        \ of major damage to structures, roadways, or infrastructure\
                        \ as a result of yesterday’s earthquake,” Murphy said. Residents\
                        \ in several homes in Newark were able to return to their\
                        \ homes Friday night after being evacuated over concerns about\
                        \ possible structural damage. Gov. Hochul and Mayor Adams\
                        \ said there were no initial reports of injuries or damage\
                        \ in New York, though it later emerged that the walls of a\
                        \ school gym in Brooklyn suffered several cracks. Engineers\
                        \ with the city Department of Buildings ordered the gymnasium\
                        \ at J.H.S. 218 in East New York shut down until repairs are\
                        \ made. The earthquake was the biggest for the tri-state area\
                        \ since 1884. The USGS recently released a study that showed\
                        \ that about 75% of the US that could experience a damaging\
                        \ earthquake in the next 100 years. Friday’s rattle should\
                        \ be a “gentle reminder” to those on the East Coast, however,\
                        \ to be prepared and familiar with “drop, cover and hold on”\
                        \ actions to stay safe in the event of another quake. New\
                        \ York City officials were blasted for emergency alerts that\
                        \ didn’t go out until 25 minutes after the earthquake struck.\
                        \ Some NYC public school alerts didn’t go out until an hour\
                        \ and a half after the shock — and were resent Saturday morning,\
                        \ telling parents that dismissal would proceed as usual."

                    title: Known terrorist spent year in US after being wrongly released
                      by feds — and GOP lawmakers demand answers
                    text: "A Somali terrorist was allowed into the country and was\
                      \ able to operate freely for almost a year before authorities\
                      \ realized their error and rearrested him. Republican lawmakers\
                      \ are demanding information from Homeland Security Secretary\
                      \ Alejandro Mayorkas about what happened to the man — and whether\
                      \ US citizens funded any part of his journey to or stay in the\
                      \ US. The 27-year-old Somalian — who so far has not been identified\
                      \ by name — was on the watchlist as “a confirmed member of al\
                      \ Shabaab” involved in the use, manufacture or transportation\
                      \ of explosives or firearms, but a border bungle meant he was\
                      \ released after initially being arrested for crossing into\
                      \ the country illegally in California in March 2023. A letter\
                      \ from Republican lawmakers seeks to find the al-Shabaab member’\
                      s path from illegally crossing the border to Minnesota, were\
                      \ he was eventually rearrested in January, and whether he received\
                      \ any government benefits. It also seeks to find if he took\
                      \ a commercial flight with US citizens to reach their state\
                      \ and if his travel was funded with taxpayer dollars, according\
                      \ to the Tuesday letter, first obtained by The Post. The letter\
                      \ states: “Due to Minnesota’s far distance from the border,\
                      \ it is not an easy task for migrants to travel to the state\
                      \ … “Did the al-Shabbab terrorist travel to Minnesota with the\
                      \ assistance, either direct or indirect of an [Non-Governmental\
                      \ Organization]? If so, which NGO was responsible for transporting\
                      \ the individual to Minnesota?” The terrorist organization member\
                      \ had initially crossed into California and been arrested by\
                      \ the Border Patrol. However, the Terrorist Screening Center\
                      \ determined he was a “mismatch” to the terror watchlist, leading\
                      \ to his release. Nearly a year later, Immigration and Customs\
                      \ Enforcement (ICE) nabbed him after federal authorities made\
                      \ a “redetermination” and realized he was associated with the\
                      \ Somalian militant group. Al-Shabaab was formed as the militant\
                      \ wing of the Somali Council of Islamic Courts, which controlled\
                      \ the southern part of the country in late 2006. Its rule was\
                      \ defeated in 2007, according to the Office of the Director\
                      \ of National Intelligence, but it has since operated as an\
                      \ underground network and is involved in wars in and around\
                      \ Somalia. It was designated a terrorist organization in 2008\
                      \ by the US government and is notorious for carrying out bombings\
                      \ and suicide attacks. In 2013, al-Shabaab was responsible for\
                      \ a massacre at the Westgate mall in Kenya, killing 67 individuals.\
                      \ US forces have conducted six strikes in Somalia against al-Shabaab\
                      \ already this year, killing two dozen militants in the latest\
                      \ actions, according to CNN. In a February press conference,\
                      \ ICE Acting Director Patrick Lechleitner said his agency arrested\
                      \ the individual “within 48 hours” of learning his true identity.\
                      \ “The Biden administration’s open-borders agenda allowed a\
                      \ known terrorist to roam freely throughout our state, and now\
                      \ they must answer for their inexcusable negligence,” House\
                      \ Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) said in a statement to The\
                      \ Post regarding the probe. The Border Patrol has recorded an\
                      \ ever-growing number of migrants listed on the terror watchlist\
                      \ attempting to enter the US illegally in recent years. Between\
                      \ October 2023 and February, agents have already recorded 70\
                      \ encounters at both the southern and northern borders, according\
                      \ to federal data. There were 172 such encounters recorded in\
                      \ fiscal year 2023, which ran from October 2022 to September\
                      \ 2023, 98 in fiscal year 2022, 16 in fiscal year 2021 and 14\
                      \ between fiscal years 2017 and 2020. In March, Border Patrol\
                      \ agents apprehended Lebanese national Basel Bassel Ebbadi,\
                      \ 22, who told personnel that he came to the US “to try to make\
                      \ a bomb,” according to internal federal documents first obtained\
                      \ by The Post. Ebbadi admitted to a border agent that he is\
                      \ a member of Hezbollah and was later confirmed as a “positive\
                      \ match” on the terror watchlist."
